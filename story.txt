It was a random summer morning, A dirndel walked along the hauptstrasse, dreading whats waiting for her at her place of work.
Walking to the market, she picked up some bratwurst for lunch and apfelkuchen for breakfast.
However, on the way to her workplace, a hund took the bratwurst from her hand and ran away.

It was a random summer morning, A dirndel walked along the hauptstrasse, dreading whats waiting for her at her place of work.
Walking to the market, she picked up some bratwurst for lunch and apfelkuchen for breakfast.
However, on the way to her workplace, a hund took the bratwurst from her hand and ran away.
After that happened she decided to get Doener to replace the bratwurst she was planning on having for lunch.
She quickly made her way into Berlin while listening to Rammstein, so she would not be late for work.
She hurried to make her way out of the hot outside and go inside to a place with Klimaanlage.
Alas, it was not be be as the Schloss she worked at was on fire!
Hurrying down the Hauptstrasse to escape the flames, she found herself in the middle of a Biergarten.
